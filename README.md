# Hordes.io User Interface
WIP: The goal of this repo is to create an open source public replacement for the official Hordes.io UI on top of the game client. 
This will likely take a while to get established and used as a learning project for some folks from the community.
For now, you can join the small [discord server](http://https://discord.gg/jpYjGv7CTb) for this project which includes a guide on how to get started.

Running for development, you'll need to run in simultaneously:
```
npm run dev-tsc
npm run dev-rollup
```
